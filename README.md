# Work-Day Scheduler
As a software developer, it is easy to lose track of time when you are writing code.  Hours go by and you don't even realize how much time you have spent.  As a result, you miss breakfast.  You partner is pissed because you forgot to help the kids with homework.  You miss a dental appointment.  And of course you may never remember to exercise.

That's why everyone needs a daily work scheduling tool.  One that allows you to specify special things you want to accomplish at all hours of the work-day.  Good schedule apps color code times so that at a glance you can see if you missed something, should be doing something right now, or if you having something coming up later in the day.  Quick color coding makes focusing on what is important on your calendar a snap.

Don't worry if you close your browser.  We use a special secret sauce in this app that will remember your calendar items when you come back later in the day.

Finally, if my employer (Bootcamp) just paid me more money, I would have added in future dates, reminders, week and month views, and integration with other calendar apps.  I'll save that for later when I am getting paid the big bucks.  For now, just enjoy a really simple and easy to use Work-day-Scheduler.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Notes about Development
The basic calendar interface was built in HTML.  While it is possible to build the calendar in JavaScript/JQuery, I opted for building the shell in HTML so that I could focus my learning/development time on dynamic functionality that needed to be done in JavaScript.

## Notes about Folders in the Repository

- The "Assets" folder contains a .gif file that provides a visual demonstration of our original assignment, and the screenshot of the working app that you see in this README.
- The "Develop" folder contains the original index.html, style.css, and the original assignmentREADME file we were given at the start of the project.
- The root director contains all the files that I fully developed to successfully run the application, and of course, this README.
